I've heard the stories swirling around the president described in a number of ways scandalous tawdry unbecoming tabloid trash the word that first comes to my mind is humiliating the president of the United States is being sued by a porn star over an alleged affair they had years ago it's humiliating for the country certainly but the figure head of the Republican Party not too long ago the party of family values is alleged to have had another affair with a playmate just after his son was born is humiliating for the GOP or it should be anyway but worst of all that Donald Trump has very likely cheated on his wife multiple times with porn stars and playmates and who knows who else and that this is all playing out very publicly is particularly humiliating for maligning intron well it's hard to imagine she didn't know who she married she's also just a woman a wife and a mother like the rest of us there's a real person in there and she must be reeling what's next is no small thing it might just be tabloid fodder for gossip rags or political charm for hill watchers but for a generation of young girls Malani is next move could be formative it was for me I was just thirteen when word of bill Clinton's affairs hit the campaign trail and imperil his nineteen ninety two presidential run I just voted for Clinton in my school's mock primary and I was paying close attention burned in my mind is the image of Hillary sitting next to bill in a sixty minutes interview trying to put a fresh veneer on her embattled candidate husband I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him and I honor what he's been through and what we've been through together and you know if that's not enough for people than heck don't vote for him it was of course just the first of many times she wooden door that particular humiliation bill would inflict stories of affairs inappropriate behavior a graphic White House tryst with an intern even a rape allegation and put on a strong United front over those years Hillary became for me what she became for many women the literal definition of stand by your man while feminists tried her out as a role model for strong women all I saw was a woman who was humiliated time and again and for reasons either personal or political decided to take it imagine if she left him gone would have been his baggage but also some of hers when she said things on the campaign campaign trail like I've always stood for women it might have actually been believable had she not spent all those years defending her husband at the expense of his accusers maybe then she would have been the person on the campaign trail that her closest friends say she was in real life warm guileless accountable instead perhaps thanks to years of over compensating for her an easy role as feminist icon her public persona was stealing aloof and offensive who knows what could have been now Malani up may not have a political career to consider but as First Lady she is an inherently important figure in American politics and women are watching particularly young women Juanita should do for this generation of girls what Hillary Clinton did not do for mine and leave her jerk of a husband
